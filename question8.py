# ### Problem 8:
# Create a function that asks the user to enter a number. If the number is between and include -50 and 5, return "Funds too low". If the number is between 5 and 50, return “You should add more funds.” If the number is more than 50, return “Just enough.”

def fundsFuntion():
    userInput = input("Enter a number")
    if userInput>=-50 and userInput<=5:
        return("Funds too low")
    elif userInput>5 and userInput<=50:
        return("You should add more funds")
    elif userInput>50:
        return("Just enough")
